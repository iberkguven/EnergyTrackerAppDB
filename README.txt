Energy Tracker App
📄 Project Overview
The Energy Tracker App is designed to monitor energy consumption, solar energy generation, and cost savings for households. It incorporates relational database structures to store and analyze detailed information about households, energy usage, and solar panel installations, with a focus on efficient data management.

This project includes:

A comprehensive Relational Schema.
An Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Diagram.
A SQL Server database backup for quick deployment.

🛠️ Features
Household Management: Tracks household details such as address and ownership.
Energy Usage Monitoring: Records daily energy consumption and categorizes it by usage type.
Solar Panel Tracking: Logs solar panel installations and generated energy data.
Cost Savings Analysis: Maintains records of energy savings over time.
Geographical Insights: Links household data to city and state information for regional analysis.
